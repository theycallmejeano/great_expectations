    Data Profiler is an [open source solution](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/) from Capital One that uses [machine learning](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/) to help companies monitor big data and detect private customer information so that it can be protected. [Data Profiler](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/open-source/basics-of-data-profiler/) provides a pre-trained deep learning model to efficiently identify sensitive information, components to conduct statistical analysis of the dataset, and an API to build data labelers. Data Profiler can accept a wide range of data formats including csv, avro, parquet, json, text, and pandas DataFrames. Whether the data is structured, semi-structured or unstructured, the library is able to identify the schema, statistics, entities from the data. Versatility of the data labeler allows models to be modified as needed and itâ€™s possible to run multiple models on the same dataset with just a few lines of code.
