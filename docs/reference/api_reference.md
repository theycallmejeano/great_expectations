title: API Documentation

:::info WIP
We are currently working on including additional classes and methods in our current API Documentation.  These documents are generated via script off of the docstrings of classes and methods that fall under our Public API.  We will be adding to these classes and methods incrementally going forward; as such you can expect this section to expand over time.  If the class or method you are looking for is not yet in these documents please reference our legacy API documentation instead.
