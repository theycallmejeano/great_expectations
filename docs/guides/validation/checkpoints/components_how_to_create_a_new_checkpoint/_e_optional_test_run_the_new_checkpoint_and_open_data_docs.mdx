Now that you have stored your Checkpoint configuration to the Store backend configured for the Checkpoint Configuration store of your Data Context, you can also test `context.run_checkpoint(...)`, right within your Jupyter Notebook by running the appropriate cells.

:::caution

Before running a Checkpoint, make sure that all classes and Expectation Suites referred to in the configuration exist.

:::

When `run_checkpoint(...)` returns, the `checkpoint_run_result` can then be checked for the value of the `success` field (all validations passed) and other information associated with running the specified <TechnicalTag tag="action" text="Actions" />.

For more advanced configurations of Checkpoints, please see [How to configure a new Checkpoint using test_yaml_config](../../../../guides/validation/checkpoints/how_to_configure_a_new_checkpoint_using_test_yaml_config.md).
