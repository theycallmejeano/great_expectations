This guide will help you create a new <TechnicalTag tag="checkpoint" text="Checkpoint" />, which allows you to couple an <TechnicalTag tag="expectation_suite" text="Expectation Suite" /> with a data set to <TechnicalTag tag="validation" text="Validate" />.

:::note

As of Great Expectations version 0.13.7, we have updated and improved the Checkpoints feature. You can continue to use your existing legacy Checkpoint workflows if you’re working with concepts from the Batch Kwargs (v2) API. If you’re using concepts from the BatchRequest (v3) API, please refer to the new Checkpoints guides.
