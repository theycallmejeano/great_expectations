You can use the following command to validate the contents of your `config` yaml string:

````python title="Python code"
context.test_yaml_config(yaml_config=config)
````

When executed, `test_yaml_config(...)` will instantiate the component and run through a self-check procedure to verify that the component works as expected.

In the case of a Checkpoint, this means:

1. Validating the yaml configuration
2. Verifying that the Checkpoint class with the given configuration, if valid, can be instantiated
3. Printing warnings in case certain parts of the configuration, while valid, may be incomplete and need to be better specified for a successful Checkpoint operation

The output will look something like this:

````console title="Terminal output"
Attempting to instantiate class from config...
Instantiating as a SimpleCheckpoint, since class_name is SimpleCheckpoint
Successfully instantiated SimpleCheckpoint


Checkpoint class name: SimpleCheckpoint
````

If something about your configuration was not set up correctly, `test_yaml_config(...)` will raise an error.
