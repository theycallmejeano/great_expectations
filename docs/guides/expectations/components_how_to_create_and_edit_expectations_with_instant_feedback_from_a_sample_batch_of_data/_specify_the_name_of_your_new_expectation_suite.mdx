Once your Datasource has been determined, you will be prompted with something similar to the following:

```bash title="Terminal output"
Name the new Expectation Suite [{DEFAULT_NAME_BASED_OFF_OF_DATASOURCE_NAME}]:
```

You may either enter the name that you wish to use, or press `enter` to proceed with the default name.

:::tip

You may skip this prompt by specifying an Expectation Suite name from the command line.  To do this, include the CLI's `--expectation-suite` flag when you enter the command to start the process, like so:

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations suite new --expectation-suite {EXPECTATION_SUITE_NAME}
```

If you provide the name of an Expectation Suite that already exists, the CLI will alert you that the specified Expectation Suite already exists, and will exit.
