One of the easiest ways to get starting in the interactive mode is to take advantage of the `--profile` flag (please see [How to create and edit Expectations with a Profiler](../how_to_create_and_edit_expectations_with_a_profiler.md)).

Following this workflow will result in your new Expectation Suite being pre-populated with Expectations based on the Profiler's results.  After using the Profiler to create your new Expectations, you can then edit them in Interactive Mode as described above.
