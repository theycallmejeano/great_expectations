If you have an existing Expectation Suite that you wish to edit in Interactive Mode, you will need to use the following command:

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations suite edit {NAME_OF_YOUR_EXPECTATION_SUITE} --interactive
```

This will open a Jupyter Notebook that will show the Expectations currently configured for your Expectation Suite.  You can then add, delete, or otherwise edit these Expectations.  When you are done, you will simply save the Expectation Suite and overwrite the old Expectations with the new ones you have executed.
