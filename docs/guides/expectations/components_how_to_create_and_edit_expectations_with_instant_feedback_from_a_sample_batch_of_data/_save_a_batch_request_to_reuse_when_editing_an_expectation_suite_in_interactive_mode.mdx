When in the Interactive Mode, the initialization cell of your Jupyter Notebook will contain the ``batch_request`` dictionary.  You can convert it to JSON and save that JSON in a file for future use.  The contents of this file would look something like this:
:::

```bash title="File contents"
{
    "datasource_name": "my_datasource",
    "data_connector_name": "my_data_connector",
    "data_asset_name": "my_asset"
}
```

You can then utilize this saved `batch_request` (containing any refinements you may have made to it in your notebook) and skip the steps of selecting its components:

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations suite new --interactive --batch-request my_saved_batch_request_file.json
```

Unless you specify the name of the Expectation Suite on the command line (using the ``--expectation_suite MY_SUITE`` syntax), the command will ask you to name your new Expectation Suite and offer you a default name for you to simply accept, or provide your own.

You can extend the previous example to specify the name of the Expectation Suite on the command line as follows:

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations suite new --expectation-suite my_suite --interactive --batch-request my_saved_batch_request.json
```
