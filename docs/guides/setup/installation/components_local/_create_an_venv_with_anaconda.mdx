Once Anaconda is installed, you can create and activate a new virtual environment by running:

```console title="Terminal command"
conda create --name YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
conda activate YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

Replace "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME" with the name you wish you use for your environment.
