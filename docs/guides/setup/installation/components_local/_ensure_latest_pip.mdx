Once your virtual environment is activated, you should ensure that you have the latest version of pip installed.

Pip is a tool that is used to easily install Python packages.  If you have Python 3 installed you can ensure that you have the latest version of pip by running either:

```bash title="Terminal command"
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

or

```bash title="Terminal command"
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
