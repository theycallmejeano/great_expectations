Python interacts with AWS through the `boto3` library.  Great Expectations makes use of this library in the background when working with AWS.  Therefore, although you will not need to use `boto3` directly, you will need to have it installed into your virtual environment.


You can do this with the pip command:

```bash title="Terminal command"
python -m pip install boto3
```

or

```bash title="Terminal command"
python3 -m pip install boto3
```

For more detailed instructions on how to set up [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) with AWS, and information on how you can use `boto3` from within Python, please reference [boto3's documentation site](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).
