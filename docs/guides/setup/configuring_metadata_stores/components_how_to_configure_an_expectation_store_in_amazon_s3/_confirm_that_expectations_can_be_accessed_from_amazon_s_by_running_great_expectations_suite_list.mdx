If you followed the optional step to copy your existing Expectations to the S3 bucket, you can confirm that Great Expectations can find them by running the command:
```bash title="Terminal input"
great_expectations suite list
```

Your output should include the Expectations you copied to Amazon S3.  In the example, these Expectations were stored in Expectation Suites named ``exp1`` and ``exp2``.  This would result in the following output from the above command:

```bash title="Terminal output"
2 Expectation Suites found:
- exp1
- exp2
```

Your output should look similar, with the names of your Expectation Suites replacing the names from the example.

If you did not copy Expectations to the new Store, you will see a message saying no Expectations were found.
