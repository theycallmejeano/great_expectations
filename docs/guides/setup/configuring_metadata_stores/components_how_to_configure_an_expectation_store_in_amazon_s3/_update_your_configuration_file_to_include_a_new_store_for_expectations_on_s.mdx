You can manually add an <TechnicalTag tag="expectation_store" text="Expectations Store" /> by adding the configuration shown below into the `stores` section of your `great_expectations.yml` file.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
stores:
  expectations_S3_store:
      class_name: ExpectationsStore
      store_backend:
          class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
          bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
          prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

To make the store work with S3 you will need to make some changes to default the ``store_backend`` settings, as has been done in the above example.  The ``class_name`` should be set to ``TupleS3StoreBackend``, ``bucket`` will be set to the address of your S3 bucket, and ``prefix`` will be set to the folder in your S3 bucket where Expectation files will be located.

For the above example, please also note that the new Store's name is set to ``expectations_S3_store``.  This value  can be any name you like as long as you also update the value of the `expectations_store_name` key to match the new Store's name.

```yaml title="File contents: great_expectations.yml"
expectations_store_name: expectations_S3_store
```

This update to the value of the `expectations_store_name` key will tell Great Expectations to use the new Store for Expectations.
