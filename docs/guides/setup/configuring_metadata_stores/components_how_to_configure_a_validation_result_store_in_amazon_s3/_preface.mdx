By default, <TechnicalTag tag="validation_result" text="Validation Results" /> are stored in JSON format in the ``uncommitted/validations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations/`` folder.  Since Validation Results may include examples of data (which could be sensitive or regulated) they should not be committed to a source control system. The following steps will help you configure a new storage location for Validation Results in Amazon S3.

<Prerequisites>

- [Configured a Data Context](../../../../tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_setup.md).
- [Configured an Expectations Suite](../../../../tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_create_expectations.md).
- [Configured a Checkpoint](../../../../tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_validate_data.md).
- The ability to install [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) in your local environment.
- Identified the S3 bucket and prefix where Validation Results will be stored.
