If you are converting an existing local Great Expectations deployment to one that works in AWS you may already have Validation Results saved that you wish to keep and transfer to your S3 bucket.

You can copy Validation Results into Amazon S3 is by using the ``aws s3 sync`` command. As mentioned earlier, the ``base_directory`` is set to ``uncommitted/validations/`` by default.

```bash title="Terminal input"
aws s3 sync '<base_directory>' s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

In the example below, two Validation Results, ``Validation1`` and ``Validation2`` are copied to Amazon S3. This results in the following output:

```bash title="Terminal output"
upload: uncommitted/validations/val1/val1.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/val1.json
upload: uncommitted/validations/val2/val2.json to s3://'<your_s3_bucket_name>'/'<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'/val2.json
```

If you have Validation Results to copy into S3, your output should look similar.
