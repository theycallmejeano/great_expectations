You can verify that your Stores are properly configured by running the command:

```bash title="Terminal command"
great_expectations store list
```

This will list the currently configured Stores that Great Expectations has access to.  If you added a new S3 Validation Results Store, the output should include the following `ValidationStore` entries:

```bash title="Terminal output"
- name: validations_store
 class_name: ValidationsStore
 store_backend:
   class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
   base_directory: uncommitted/validations/

- name: validations_S3_store
 class_name: ValidationsStore
 store_backend:
   class_name: TupleS3StoreBackend
   bucket: '<your_s3_bucket_name>'
   prefix: '<your_s3_bucket_folder_name>'
```

Notice the output contains two Validation Results Stores: the original ``validations_store`` on the local filesystem and the ``validations_S3_store`` we just configured.  This is ok, since Great Expectations will look for Validation Results on the S3 bucket as long as we set the ``validations_store_name`` variable to ``validations_S3_store``.
