Use the following CLI command: `great_expectations docs build --site-name s3_site` to build and open your newly configured S3 Data Docs site.

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations docs build --site-name s3_site
```

You will be presented with the following prompt:

```bash title="Terminal output"
The following Data Docs sites will be built:

 - s3_site: https://s3.amazonaws.com/data-docs.my_org/index.html

Would you like to proceed? [Y/n]:
```

Signify that you would like to proceed by pressing the `return` key or entering `Y`.  Once you have you will be presented with the following messages:

```bash title="Terminal output"
Building Data Docs...

Done building Data Docs
```

If successful, the CLI will also open your newly built S3 Data Docs site and provide the URL, which you can share as desired. Note that the URL will only be viewable by users with IP addresses appearing in the above policy.

:::tip

You may want to use the `-y/--yes/--assume-yes` flag with the `great_expectations docs build --site-name s3_site` command.  This flag causes the CLI to skip the confirmation dialog.

This can be useful for non-interactive environments.
