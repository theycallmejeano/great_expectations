If you wish to create an Expectation Suite from the CLI without opening a Jupyter Notebook, you can do so by including the `--no-jupyter` flag in your command to the CLI.

```bash title="Terminal input"
> great_expectations suite new --no-jupyter
```

This will create an empty Expectation Suite, which you can then edit by using the `great_expectations suite edit` command, or in an external script.
